# Fizz Buzz

This algorithm test is mostly used in testings applicant during job interview. It's used to test your problem solvong abilities.

## Question

Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).

But:
* for multiples of three, print Fizz (instead of the number)
* for multiples of five, print Buzz (instead of the number)
* for multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz (instead of the number)


### Modulus Operator 

In order to be able to solve the algorithm, we have to know about modulus operator. "% ".
Modulus operator is used to get the remainer after the number has been divided

```javascript
    console.log(7 % 3);
    => 1

    console.log(10 % 5);
    => 0
```
